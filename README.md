# TicTacToe_AI
## Info
classical AI application for playing TicTacToe. 

Uses Minimax and AlphaBeta pruning.


## Version 2

The application was then generalized and asks for a board size.

Plays optimally on any board size.

The computation time explodes with size since no oracle function was implemented to reduce its depth.
