# TicTacToe_AI
classical AI application for playing TicTacToe. 

Uses Minimax and AlphaBeta pruning.

The application was then generalized and asks for a board size.
Plays optimally on any board size, although the computation amount explodes with size, since no oracle function was implemented to reduce its depth.
